This repository is a resource for those who want to learn Python. However, instead of just copying and running these codes, try modifying them to enhance your learning. Real learning begins when you start creating your own projects. 

To avoid falling into Tutorial Hell, focus on understanding the logic behind these codes and writing your own. The best way to learn is by building your own projects.
